   *
   * `matrix`/`translate`/`rotate`/`scale` and `style` used to sit alongside this, each describing a
   * change by its parameters — a delta, an angle, a colour — so undo could re-derive the old state
   * by applying an inverse. None is needed any more: a transform writes to `symbol.transform` and a
   * restyle to `symbol.style`, both part of the record, so the record *is* the state. Restoring it
   * is exact by construction, where inverting a parameter was arithmetic that could drift — and,
   * for a scale's `1 / scaleX`, could be `Infinity` or ignore the origin it was taken about.
   *
   * A list of pairs, not two parallel lists: `{ oldSymbols, newSymbols }` let the two fall out of
   * step, and a length mismatch silently paired the wrong symbols together on undo. Here the
   * pairing is the type.
   *
   * `before`/`after` rather than `old`/`new`: `new` reads as the operator wherever it appears, and
   * these two words are the ones the rest of this code already uses for a snapshot and its result.
   *
   * Several sources can contribute to a single undoable step — a transform records both the symbols
   * dragged and the connected edges recomputed from them — so append with {@link appendUpdated}
   * rather than assigning.
