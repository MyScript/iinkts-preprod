/**
 * @group SymbolUtils
 * @summary A symbol drawn as a single `<path>`.
 *
 * The shape of most of what the library renders — a stroke, a geometric shape, an edge. Each one
 * used to build a `<g>`, append one `<path>` to it and return the group, which is three copies of an
 * assembly that differs only in what goes on the path.
 *
 * **There is no group any more.** A group holding exactly one child adds a node per symbol and
 * carries nothing the child could not carry itself: `id`, `type` and `kind` are found by attribute
 * either way, `transform` on a single child is the same transform, and `stroke-linecap` and
 * `stroke-linejoin` inherit. On a 4419-symbol document that is 4419 nodes the browser no longer
 * lays out.
 *
 * **One attribute did not merely move: `vector-effect`.** It is not an inherited property, so on the
 * group it applied to the group — which draws nothing — and never reached the path. It was inert.
 * On the path it takes effect, and `non-scaling-stroke` means what it says: stroke width stops
 * growing with the zoom, since the renderer zooms by `viewBox`. That is a deliberate change of
 * appearance, not a side effect — the attribute had been asking for this since it was written.
 *
 * A type in this family says what its path is worth drawing — its `d`, and the fill, stroke and
 * width around it — and inherits the rest.
