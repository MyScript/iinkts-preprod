 * There used to be a `switch` here with a branch per built-in type, calling each family's `Ops`
 * directly and falling back to the registry only for unknown types. That made the registry a
 * second-class path: `ShapeUtil.create` and `EdgeUtil.create` were never reached, so the `switch`
 * on `kind` inside them was dead code kept alive by a contract nobody called.
 *
 * Requires {@link registerBuiltinSymbolUtils} to have run. Both canvases that create symbols from
 * partials call it in `initialize()`, and the error below says so rather than letting a missing
 * registration surface as a `TypeError`.
