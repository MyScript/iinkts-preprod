 * Register with `symbolRegistry.register(new MyUtil())`.

 * @example
 * class StickyNoteUtil extends SymbolUtil<TStickyNote> {
 *   readonly type = "sticky-note"
 *   create(partial) { ... }
 *   getGeometry(s) { ... }
 *   translate(s, { matrix }) { ... }

 *   resize(s, { matrix }) { ... }
 *   getSVGElement(s) { ... }
