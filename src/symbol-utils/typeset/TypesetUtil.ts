/**
 * @group SymbolUtils
 * @summary What text and math share, which is nearly everything.
 *
 * `TText` and `TMath` are the same shape but for the list they hold — `chars` against `elements` —
 * so the two utils were the same code twice over. Worse, the resize path was literally one method
 * on `IIResizeManager` that branched on `isText(symbol)` twice, once to reach the right list and
 * once to reach the right derive.
 *
 * A typeset symbol used to differ from a geometric one in how it turns and resizes: it recorded an
 * angle instead of moving a coordinate, and rebuilt its bounds from scale factors instead of
 * rescaling anything by hand. Both of those were per-type code, and both are gone — `translate`,
 * `rotate` and `resize` are `SymbolUtil`'s now, composing the matrix like every other type. What is
 * left here is the one thing that is still genuinely different: a typeset symbol is **measured, not
 * computed** — its bounds come from drawing it into the DOM hidden and reading `getBBox()`, always
 * unrotated and unscaled, because turning and scaling are the matrix's job from here on.
