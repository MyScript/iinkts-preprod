 * - `isClosed` — does the last vertex join back to the first? A polygon does, a polyline does not.
 *   It decides whether {@link Geometry2d.edges} emits a closing edge, and so what the perimeter is.
 * - `isFilled` — does the inside belong to the shape? A rectangle with a fill does, the same
 *   rectangle drawn as an outline does not. It decides whether a point strictly inside, touching no
 *   edge, counts as a hit.
 *
 * Options on the base rather than separate subclasses: a filled and an unfilled polygon differ in
 * one predicate, not in how either computes anything.

/**
 * @group Core/Geometry
 * @summary A shape that can answer questions about itself.
 *
 * Geometry used to be data — a `{ bounds, vertices, edges, length }` record each symbol type built
 * for itself — and every type then had to carry its own `overlaps`, because a record cannot be
 * asked anything. Six of the eight ended up as the same call, `polygonOverlapsBox`, and the two
 * that did not (a stroke tests its pointers, a circle tests its radius) had to be special-cased
 * elsewhere. Here the shape answers, so a symbol type only has to say what shape it is.
 *
 * **The hole this closes.** `polygonOverlapsBox` is "the shape's bounds sit inside the query, or
 * some edge crosses some side of it". Both halves are about the boundary, so a query landing
 * entirely *within* a shape without touching its outline was missed — a real miss for a filled
 * shape, and correct for an unfilled one. Nothing in a plain record could tell those apart;
 * {@link TGeometry2dOptions.isFilled} does.
 *
 * **Derived values are computed once per instance.** `vertices`, `edges`, `bounds` and `length` all
 * fall out of each other, and a caller that reads bounds usually reads vertices next. Instances are
 * themselves cached per symbol by `SymbolGeometry`, so "once per instance" is once per symbol
 * version — there is no invalidation to get wrong, because a changed symbol is a different object
 * and gets a different instance.
