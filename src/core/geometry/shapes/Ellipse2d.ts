/**

 * An ellipse is the image of the unit circle under a linear map, and this is that map: the point at
 * angle `t` is `center + (xx·cos t + xy·sin t, yx·cos t + yy·sin t)`. `(xx, yx)` is where (1, 0)
 * lands and `(xy, yy)` where (0, 1) does.
 *
 * Stored this way rather than as radii and an orientation because it is what makes
 * {@link Ellipse2d.transform} exact and cheap: carrying an ellipse through a matrix is composing the
 * two maps, where radii and an angle would have to be recovered from the product — a singular value
 * decomposition, per transform, to describe the same thing.
