## Features

- **Text**: real-time recognition in 72 languages, vertical Japanese included.
- **Math**: more than 200 symbols, a solver that evaluates and solves what you write, variables shared between blocks, and results that recompute when a variable changes.
- **Diagrams**: shapes and connectors are recognized as you draw, connectors stay attached when you move a shape, and the whole diagram converts to clean typeset shapes.
- **Editing gestures**: scratch-out, strike-through, surround, underline, insert and join.
- **Pen nibs**: ballpoint, pencil, fountain pen and brush, from the same captured stroke.
- **Export**: JIIX, text, JSON, SVG, PNG, Markdown, Mermaid, PlantUML, prompt-ready blocks for LLMs, and PDF.
- **Integrations**: runs inside [tldraw](https://tldraw.dev) and [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) whiteboards.
- **Customizable**: themes and styles, menus you can extend or replace, keyboard shortcuts, minimap, zoom and pan.
- **Resilient**: reconnects on its own after a network drop and replays what was written offline.

You can discover all the features on our Developer website for [Text](https://developer.myscript.com/features/text) and [Math](https://developer.myscript.com/features/math).

## Requirements

1. Have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
2. Have a MyScript developer account. You can create one [here](https://developer.myscript.com/support/account/registering-myscript-cloud/).
3. Get your keys and the free monthly quota to access MyScript Cloud at [developer.myscript.com](https://developer.myscript.com/getting-started/web)

## Installation

iinkTS can be installed with the well known package managers `npm`, `yarn`.

If you want to use `npm` or `yarn` you first have to init a project (or use an existing one).

```shell
npm init
OR
yarn init
```

You can then install iinkTS and use it as showed in the [Usage](#usage) section.

```shell
npm install iink-ts
OR
yarn add iink-ts
```

## Usage

### Universal Module Definition (UMD)

1. Create an `index.html` file in the same directory.

2. Add the following lines in the `head` section of your file to use iinkTS and the css :

```html
<script src="node_modules/iink-ts/dist/iink.min.js"></script>
```

3. Still in the `head` section, add a `style` and specify the height and the width of your canvas:

```html
<style>
  #canvas {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
</style>
```

4. In the `body` tag, create a `div` tag that will contain the drawing area:

```html
<div id="canvas"></div>
```

5. In JavaScript and within a `<script>` tag placed before the closing `</body>` tag, create the canvas using the `load` function, your HTML element, the desired type and the possible options depending on the type, then initialize it:

```javascript
    const canvasElement = document.getElementById('canvas');
    const options = {
      configuration: {
        server: {
          scheme: "https",
          host: "cloud.myscript.com",
          applicationKey: "<YOU-APPLICATION-KEY>",
          hmacKey: "<YOUR-HMAC-KEY>", // development only: in production, use sign (see Authentication)
        }
      }
    }
    const canvasType = "INTERACTIVE_INK" /* or INTERACTIVE_INK_SSR or INK_V1 or INK_V2 */
    const canvas = iink.Canvas.load(canvasElement, canvasType, options);
```

6. Your `index.html` file should look like this:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="node_modules/iink-ts/dist/iink.min.js"></script>
    <style>
      #canvas {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="canvas"></div>
    <script>
      const canvasElement = document.getElementById("canvas")
      const options = {
        configuration: {
          server: {
            scheme: "https",
            host: "cloud.myscript.com",
            applicationKey: "<YOU-APPLICATION-KEY>",
            hmacKey: "<YOUR-HMAC-KEY>", // development only: in production, use sign (see Authentication)
          },
        }
      }
      const canvasType = "INTERACTIVE_INK" /* or INTERACTIVE_INK_SSR or INK_V1 or INK_V2 */
      const canvas = iink.Canvas.load(canvasElement, canvasType, options)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

7. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve your folder content using any web server.

You can find this guide, and a more complete example on the [MyScript Developer website](https://developer.myscript.com/docs/interactive-ink/latest/web/iinkts/).

### ECMAScript module (ESM)

1. Create an `index.html` file in the same directory.

2. Add the following lines in the `body` section of your file to use iinkTS and the css :

```html
<body>
  <div id="canvasEl"></div>

  <script type="module">
    import { Canvas, getAvailableLanguageList } from "../../dist/iink.esm.js"
    const canvasElement = document.getElementById("canvasEl")

    const options = {
      configuration : {
        server: {
          scheme: "https",
          host: "cloud.myscript.com",
          applicationKey: "<YOU-APPLICATION-KEY>",
          hmacKey: "<YOUR-HMAC-KEY>", // development only: in production, use sign (see Authentication)
        },
      }
    }

    const canvasType =
      "INTERACTIVE_INK" /* or INTERACTIVE_INK_SSR or INK_V1 or INK_V2 */
    const canvas = await Canvas.load(canvasElement, canvasType, options)
  </script>
</body>
```

3. Your `index.html` file should look like this:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      #canvasEl {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="canvasEl"></div>
    <script type="module">
      import { Canvas, getAvailableLanguageList } from '../../dist/iink.esm.js'
      const canvasElement = document.getElementById('canvasEl')

      const options = {
        configuration: {
          server: {
            scheme: "https",
            host: "cloud.myscript.com",
            applicationKey: "<YOU-APPLICATION-KEY>",
            hmacKey: "<YOUR-HMAC-KEY>", // development only: in production, use sign (see Authentication)
          }
        }
      }

      const canvas = await Canvas.load(canvasElement, 'INTERACTIVE_INK_SSR', options)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Authentication

The MyScript server checks an HMAC signature computed with your HMAC key. **Do not ship the HMAC key to
the browser**: anyone can read it there and use your quota. Keep it on a server you own and let the
canvas ask that server for each signature with `server.sign`:

```javascript
const options = {
  configuration: {
    server: {
      scheme: "https",
      host: "cloud.myscript.com",
      applicationKey: "<YOU-APPLICATION-KEY>",
      hmacKey: "",
      sign: async (message) => {
        const response = await fetch("/sign", {
          method: "POST",
          headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
          body: JSON.stringify({ message }),
        })
        return (await response.json()).signature
      },
    },
  },
}
```

`message` is the WebSocket HMAC challenge, or the body of an HTTP recognition request. The server
returns HMAC-SHA512 of it, keyed by the application key followed by the HMAC key, as lowercase hex. In
Node:

```javascript
import { createHmac } from "node:crypto"

const signature = createHmac("sha512", APPLICATION_KEY + HMAC_KEY).update(message).digest("hex")
```

Put the signing route behind your own authentication and rate-limit it: whoever can call it can get
messages signed. [`examples/server-signing/server.js`](./examples/server-signing/server.js) is a complete, dependency-free
signing server with a page that holds no credential at all:

```shell
node --env-file=.env.local examples/server-signing/server.js
```

`hmacKey` as a string remains for development and prototypes.

## Architecture

If you're integrating iinkTS or rebuilding your own client from scratch, these diagrams cover the class organization and the WebSocket protocol:

- [architecture/interactive-ink-canvas.md](./architecture/interactive-ink-canvas.md) — class diagram of the `INTERACTIVE_INK` (WebSocket, real-time) variant and its managers.
- [architecture/ink-canvas.md](./architecture/ink-canvas.md) — class diagram of the `INK_V2` (HTTP batch) variant and the deprecated `INK_V1`.
- [architecture/websocket-protocol.md](./architecture/websocket-protocol.md) — sequence diagram of the messages exchanged between the WebSocket client and the MyScript backend (auth, session, strokes, recognition, export, undo/redo, errors/reconnection).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the error: `Unrecognized property: convert.force`, this means your server version is lower than 2.3.0.
To correct the problem, you have 2 options:

- either update your server
- either add in the iink-ts configuration `configuration.server.info.version = 2.2.0`

If you encounter the error: `Unrecognized property: configuration.export.jiix.text.lines`, this means your server version is lower than 3.2.0.
To correct the problem, you have 2 options:

- either update your server
- either add in the iink-ts configuration `configuration.server.info.version = 3.1.0`
