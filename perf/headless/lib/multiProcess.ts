/**
 * Runs the bench in several **independent processes** and aggregates them.
 *
 * Why processes and not repeats: repeats inside one process share JIT state, heap layout and GC
 * history, so their dispersion is correlated and far narrower than the real run-to-run variance —
 * measured on 2026-08-27, where the import case drifted 15.5% between two unchanged runs while its
 * in-process spread claimed 2.5%.
 *
 * Both the baseline and the run the gate judges go through here, with the same statistic, so the two
 * sides of a comparison are the same kind of number. They differ only in how many processes they can
 * afford: the baseline is recorded once and deliberately, a CI run is paid on every build.
