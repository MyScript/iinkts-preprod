 * There used to be one shared factor of 20, which is the same mistake as one shared threshold: the
 * cases span seven orders of magnitude, so a single number cannot put them all in a measurable band.
 * At 20 passes one iteration of `getRootSymbol` cost 0.00003 ms — below the resolution of
 * `performance.now()`, so it timed the clock rather than the code, and then failed CI at +21%
 * against a 15% limit on a tree nobody had touched.
 *
 * A factor is not only about cost. `getRootSymbol` cleared the floor at 100 000 repeats of a single
 * lookup and still read badly, because repeating one key is a shape the JIT treats unstably and is
 * not what the library does either. Rotating over every resident id fixed both at once.
 *
 * Each factor lives beside its case and is chosen from a measurement, targeting **0.1-10 ms per
 * iteration**. A case whose smallest indivisible unit already costs more than the band keeps a factor
 * of 1 and sits above it.
 *
 * They are constants, not calibrated at runtime, on purpose: the two sides of an A/B comparison must
 * do byte-for-byte the same work, and a factor recomputed per run would not guarantee that.
