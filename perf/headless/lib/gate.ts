/**
 * The gate's decision, as a pure function of one paired run.
 *
 * It used to compare a run against `baseline.json`, a recording of another machine on another day.
 * That was abandoned for a measured reason: the dispersion such a baseline reports is not
 * reproducible — recorded three times from unchanged code on one quiet machine, every case's tail
 * moved by a factor of two to five — so every threshold derived from it was a lottery. What the gate
 * reads now is the ratio of two builds measured here, alternating, which has no baseline to go stale
 * and no second machine to disagree with.
 *
 * It is a separate module from `compare.ts` for one reason: the rule below is what failed on
 * unchanged code more than once, so it needs unit tests, and a top-level script that reads files and
 * calls `process.exit` cannot have any.
 *
 * Deliberately free of imports, including type-only ones. Not a style choice: the harness runs under
 * node's type stripping, which needs `.ts` in a specifier, and the jest config that runs the unit test
 * emits, so it cannot enable `allowImportingTsExtensions`. One of the two would break. That is why the
 * median absolute deviation below is spelled out here instead of coming from `stats.ts` — it is six
 * lines and it does not move; if it ever needs to, change both. `TPairedReport` from
 * `../lib/multiProcess.ts` structurally satisfies `TPairedGateReport`.
