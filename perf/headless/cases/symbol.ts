 * How many of the pooled strokes one iteration builds geometry for.

 * Not the whole 4419 the two cases above use, and the difference is measured rather than chosen for
 * symmetry. At the full set one iteration costs 15.25 ms — above the 0.1-10 ms band — so tinybench
 * stops at its 20-sample floor, and a p50 over 20 draws of a right-skewed latency distribution is
 * coarse. Over 24 paired rounds of byte-identical bundles that read x0.984 with a **37.8% tail**,
 * worse than the gate's own 20% floor: an instrument that cannot see the regression it exists to
 * catch.
 *
 * A smaller slice fixes both halves at once — more samples inside the time budget, and less garbage
 * per iteration, which matters for a case whose whole subject is allocation. At 1000 it costs
 * 3.20 ms and the same 24 paired rounds read x0.984 with a **16.4% tail**, under the floor.
 *
 * Read that gain against the control, not raw: the machine was quieter on the second run (the
 * control's own tail went 22.7% to 12.9%), so the honest figure is this case's tail *relative to the
 * control's*, 1.67x before and 1.27x after. Real, and smaller than the raw numbers suggest.

      // that made the geometry 20% dearer would surface there as +2.6%, well under the gate's own 20%
      // floor (`MIN_THRESHOLD`), so the suite would pass and say nothing. That blind spot is this
      // case's whole reason to exist.

      // and becomes a class instance.
      //
      // Reaching for the util directly rather than through `SymbolGeometry` is what makes this
      // repeatable: the facade caches on symbol identity, so a second read of the same symbol is a
      // `WeakMap` hit and measures the cache instead. The util's own method holds no cache and
      // recomputes every call, so the same pre-built strokes can be measured over and over — which
      // is the only way to keep construction out of the window, since a case runs at least
      // `MIN_ITERATIONS` times and pre-building a fresh set per iteration is what we are removing.

      // The strokes come from `geometryWarmStrokes`: already warmed in the facade's cache, which
      // this path never consults, so the cases share one pool instead of allocating a second.

      // remove. This path is pure — it allocates an object and returns it — which is precisely the
      // shape escape analysis is allowed to delete outright, and a case measuring a deleted
      // allocation would read as a fast one. Checking the total is one comparison per invocation,
      // not per symbol, and doubles as proof that every symbol really did yield a geometry.
